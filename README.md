Just trying some stuff out, first time trying to code pretty much anything.


TO-DO LIST
-----------
1. Enemy spells - Still mostly broken
2. More spells (divine shield, also for enemies) - Done, I think
3. Randomized enemy stats (minimum and maximum)
4. Enemy variants
5. Status effects
6. Save system
7. Chapter 2
